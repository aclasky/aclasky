## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## Professional
I have a PhD in Chemical Engineering and I'm currently working on developing **self-driving labs (SDLs)** to accelerate materials discovery. My main focus is on therapeutics but materials science applies to all kinds of different problems. While I have some background in coding, I am looking to improve my skills.
